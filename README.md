# Template Python Projects

A comprehensive template repository for Python projects, designed to provide a solid foundation for developing, testing, and deploying Python applications.

## Features

- **Project Structure**: Well-organized directory layout following Python best practices
- **Testing Framework**: Pre-configured testing setup with pytest
- **Code Quality**: Integrated linting and formatting with Ruff and Mypy via pre-commit
- **Virtual Environment**: uv-based dependency management
- **CI/CD Ready**: GitHub Actions configuration templates
- **Development Tools**: Pre-commit hooks and development utilities


## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.13 or higher
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (for dependency management)

### Installation

1. Use the template:

Click the button `Use this template` -> `Create a new repository`

## Development

### Running Tests

## After Cloning or Using as Template

Before starting development, make sure to apply the following changes:

1. **Rename the source folder**: `src/template-python-project/` → `src/<your-project-name>/`

2. **Update `pyproject.toml`**:
   - Change `name`, `version`, `description` and other metadata fields

3. **Update pre-commit hook versions** in `.pre-commit-config.yaml` to the latest available:
   - Check [pre-commit-hooks releases](https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks/releases)
   - Check [ruff-pre-commit releases](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-pre-commit/releases)
   - Check [mirrors-mypy releases](https://github.com/pre-commit/mirrors-mypy/releases)
   - You can also check if the commented lines are useful for you.

4. **Install pre-commit hooks**:
```bash
uv run pre-commit install
```

5. **Configure GitHub Actions permissions**:
Go to your repository **Settings → Actions → General → Workflow permissions** and enable **"Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests"** if you want workflows to open PRs automatically.
